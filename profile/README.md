# Introduction to Security
## Welcome to CS 370: Introduction to Security
*"Why do we care about computer security?"*

*"What are the basic principles of computer security?"*

*"What are the areas of computer security (and research!)?"*

If you have ever asked these questions at least once so far, this course would be the right choice for you.

This is an introductory course on computer security (and even privacy; exciting!) with an objective to learn basic security principles, expose yourself to the areas of computer security (and research; double-excitement!), and have opportunities to do hands-on practices. Here are the topics we will cover through 10-week with hands-on micro-assignments.:
- Basic cryptography
- Network security
- Internet security
- Software security
- Trustworthy ML
- Usable security

This course employs the format of Capture-The-Flag (CTF) challenges. You will not only learn the concepts and techniques, but you will also have numerous opportunities to apply them to near-to-commercial-scale systems. This class should be fun!
